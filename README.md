Theater-Simulation
Imagine you’ve been hired to help the manager for a small, local movie theater. The theater has been receiving poor reviews due to their long wait times. The manager, who is just as concerned about cost as he is about customer satisfaction, can only afford to keep so many employees on staff. The manager is particularly worried about what chaos can unfold once those blockbusters start coming out: lines wrapping around the theater, employees stretched to their limit, angry moviegoers missing the opening scenes… This is definitely a situation to avoid! After checking the reviews, the manager was able to determine that a given moviegoer to their theater is willing to spend at most 10 minutes from the time they arrive until the time they put their butt in a seat. In other words, the average wait time for a night at the theater needs to be 10 minutes or less. The manager has asked for your help to figure out a solution to getting customer wait times under this 10 minute requirement
